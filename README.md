Board
=====

Board is a diagram (graph visualisation) library ported from [JGraphX](https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx) to
[Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) and released under the BSD license. 

Board provides functionality for visualisation and interaction with node-edge graphs (not charts). Example 
applications that you might write with it are a workflow editor, an organisational chart, a business process modelling 
tool, a UML tool, an electronic circuit diagrammer, network/telecoms visualisation (you get the idea, things with 
nodes and edges that connect those nodes, a mathematical graph).

Board also includes functionality like XML stencils support, various import/export and layouting (automatically 
node/edge positioning).
